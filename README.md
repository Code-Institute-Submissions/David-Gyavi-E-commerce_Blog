### **Design Choices**

I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") to come up with a color scheme that matches the atmosphere of a Ecommerce site.
For this website I have deciced to keep design simple, meaning I opted for a white background color with some Orange white for the Home.
I have added some color (black) for the buttons, navigation bar is left eith a white background design more visually appealing to the user. 
The reason for this is that for this project, the functionality is much more important and as there are a lot of functionalities I don't want to distract the user with overwhelming colors. 

<a></a>

#### Colors

Like I mentioned before, But all the colors I have used mostlty have followed that of the Ado-Botique project colors that fit well with the feeling of a Ecommerce site.
Below I will explain more why I choose the various colors and for what I will be using them.

![Color Palette](wireframes/color-palette.png)

* #ffffff: I have decided to keep the background of the overall website white in order give the clean look. I will also use this color as text color for the nav bar and buttons.
* #D9D9D9: This color I will use as a background color for whole dashboard. 
* #F5F5F5: This color I will use as a background color for the logs on the dashboard in order to have a small contract versus #D9D9D9 dashboard color.
* #284B63: This will be the color that I will use for my navigation bar and buttons in order to give a bit of color to the website. This color will also be used as the overall text color.

I have used a contrast checker in order to make sure that the contrast is sufficient.
This way my content will be easily readable. 

<a></a>

#### Fonts
In order to find appropriate fonts for my website, I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com "Google Fonts") to explore the various options.
For the titles and subtitles, I have used the font [Play](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto "Roboto") 
and for the main text I have used [Cormorant Garamond](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto "Roboto"). 

<a></a>

#### Structure

I have chosen to use [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) to create an overall structure for my website. 
Materialize provides various elements of CSS and Javascript which is very helpful to keep a good structure on your page. 
The reason why I choose Materiaize is mainly due to the various features they offer like a datepicker, floating action button etc.
