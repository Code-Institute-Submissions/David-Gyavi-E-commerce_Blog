## **Goal for this project**

Have of you ever gone to a store full of computers and all computer accessories, reaching there when you even don't know what you want to take. Being asked lots of quetions but is 
more of beter to make it easire for people to access each and every stuff they would like to get or to buy while sitted at home on there computers or other gadgets to access what ever they want.
This case they ask you which type of part or computer you would like to take, which specifications would you like yet you know nothing.

The E-Commerce-Site will help and make your life more esier. How By just sitting down and start searching for each and everything and even knowing which kind is good and there prices as well.

Therefore in case you dont buy online it will be easy for you to know which kind of machine you like and what ever they ask you about you know exactly because you took time to search on web and 
find precisely what you wanted to do. So here you will be able to register and also signin so that all the items you bye are easily followed and you also get a bonus of creating an account.
